## Algorithms and Programming
#### Problems and Solutions | by Alexander Shen

> Algorithms and Programming is primarily intended for a first-year undergraduate course in programming. It is structured in a problem-solution format that requires the student to think through the programming process, thus developing an understanding of the underlying theory. Although the author assumes some moderate familiarity with programming constructs, the book is easily readable by a student taking a basic introductory course in computer science.
